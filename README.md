# Meme It So

Meme It So is a media (TV show and Movie) screen capture and text caption                                                                                                                     
database and image macro generator.

It is (clearly) heavily inspired by Frinkiac. I was motivated to create a Frinkiac-like
app for Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Server is agnostic to the content.

Client-side is currently themed for Star Trek. In the future I
may try to make it more generic for easy installion for any show.
